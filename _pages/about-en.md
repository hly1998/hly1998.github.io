# About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third-year PhD candidate in School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and a member of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence, supervised by Prof. Enhong Chen (http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). My research focuses on information retrieval, efficient representation learning, and retrieval-augmented generation. In recent years, I have published/accepted more than 20 papers in important international academic journals and conferences in the fields of data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence such as TOIS, KDD, WWW, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, ACMMM, etc. I have applied for/authorized 5 national invention patents. I have received honors such as National Scholarship for Doctoral Students and Yang Yuanqing Scholarship.
